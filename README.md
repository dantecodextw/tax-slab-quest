**Question:**

Create a JavaScript function `calculateTax` that accurately determines income tax based on a series of tax slabs. Each slab is defined by a start value, end value, and a tax percentage. The function must adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Slab Processing:** Tax slabs may not be provided in ascending order. The function should first sort them by their start values to ensure correct calculation order.
2. **Range Handling:** Each slab's tax percentage applies only to the portion of the income that falls within its [start, end) range (i.e., inclusive of `start`, exclusive of `end`). If the remaining income exceeds the slab's range, tax the entire range. Otherwise, tax only the remaining income.
3. **Error Checking:** 
   - Validate that `income` is positive and slabs are valid non-empty arrays.
   - Ensure no slab has an invalid range (e.g., `start` â‰¥ `end`).
   - Throw an error if the slabs do not fully cover the income (e.g., remaining income after processing all slabs is still positive).

**Example Test Cases:**
```javascript
// Test 1: Income 150000
calculateTax(150000, [
  { start: 100001, end: 500000, p: 2 }, // Slab 2
  { start: 0, end: 100000, p: 0 },      // Slab 1 (sorted first)
]);
// Output: 1000 (taxed 50000 * 2%)

// Test 2: Income 400000
calculateTax(400000, [
  { start: 0, end: 100000, p: 0 },
  { start: 100001, end: 300000, p: 1 },
  { start: 300001, end: 500000, p: 2 },
]);
// Output: 2000 + 2000 = 4000 (taxed 200000*1% + 100000*2%)

// Test 3: Income 600000 with incomplete slabs
calculateTax(600000, [
  { start: 0, end: 300000, p: 0 },
  { start: 300001, end: 500000, p: 1 },
]);
// Throws Error: "Insufficient slabs to cover income"
```

**Provide the function implementation that meets these criteria.**
